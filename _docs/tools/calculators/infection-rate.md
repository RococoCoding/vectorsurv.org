---
The pool infection rate calculator estimates the arbovirus infection rate based on testing pools of mosquitoes. This calculator is based on the [CDC/DVBID MLE/MIR Microsoft Excel add-in](<https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resourcepages/mosqSurvSoft.html>).

## Fields
* **Agency**: Choose the agency or agencies for which you wish to calculate an infection rate. Multiple agencies can be selected by using the *CTRL/CMD/SHIFT* keys while selecting values. This could be your own agency to compare the current year to past years, or more than one agency to compare to neighboring districts. If the Treat each selected agency independently box is checked, the abundance anomaly will be stratified by agency (ignored if only one agency is selected). If left unchecked, the infection rate will be aggregated for all selected agencies.
* **Date Period**:
* **# of Date Periods**:
* **Spatial Filter**: This feature allows you to filter results within the agency or agencies. You can draw a polygon on the map using the feature tab, or include a previously saved feature from the [Spatial Features]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tools/spatial-tools) page. ![Polygon example]({{ site.baseur1 }}/assets/images/docs/spatial-feature-tools.PNG) Alternatively, you can filter by [site group]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/site/site-group), region (determined when creating a [new site]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/site)), or specific site. For these filters, multiple values can be selected by using the *CTRL/CMD/SHIFT* keys while selecting values. If the *Treat each selected filter independently* box is checked, the infection rate will be stratified by spatial filter, otherwise the rate will be aggregated for the selection.
* **Target/Virus**:
* **Species**:
* **Sex/Condition**:
* **Trap Type**:
* **Point Estimate**:
* **Confidence Interval**:
* **Scale**:
