Submit saved pools to be tested for the presence of arboviruses.

* **Select a lab**: Choose whether the pool will be sent to a central laboratory (i.e. DART in California) for testing or if the testing will be conducted in-house. You also have the option to change the [default]({{ site.baseur1 }}/docs/arthropod/trap-types) lab for testing.
* **Select pools**: All saved pools from the selected time period will be displayed on the table. Use the checkboxes to indicate which virus(es) and/or viral triplex(es) the pool(s) will be tested for. Exact viruses may vary depending on the state; this example shows the testing options for California.
