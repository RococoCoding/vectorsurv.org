Creating site groups is a way to organize trap sites that are commonly analyzed together. This makes it easier to select certain sites when filtering results with the data tools and calculators.

### New Site Group
You must designate a name for your new site group, then select as many sites from the Available column as desired. Multiple sites can be selected by using the *CTRL/CMD/SHIFT* keys while selecting values. Once the sites are selected, click on the **>>** button to add them to the Selected column. Sites can be removed by highlighting the site name and clicking on the **<<** button. You can choose whether to add any comments and/or share the new site group with other users from your agency.
