Estimate survival curves from bottle bioassay results.

You will see a table of all submitted bottle bioassay tests sorted by date (the most recent tests appear first). Check the box to select specific tests to include in the calculation. Selected tests will be moved from the **Bottle Bioassays** table to the **Selected Tests** table at the bottom of the page. Unchecking the box from this table will undo the move.

When you click the **Calculate** button, the output for each test will appear beneath the tables. Clicking the *Graph* link will automatically graph mortality curves from these results.
