Sites are essentially bookmarks for trap locations.  They will help you quickly record and collection events and pool tests without having to locate them on a map or type in coordinates each time.

* **Site Code**: A 6-8 digit numeric identifier for the site.  Must be unique to the agency, but not throughout the system.  Each agency can assign codes however they want.  A code of all 0s is given to each agency at their headquarters.
* **Site Name**: An easier to remember name for the site.  Site Code and Site Name will be searchable and autocompleted on the data entry screens so it's helpful to assign this field.
* **Coordinates**: The spatial location for the site.  Can be assigned by typing in latitude/longitude,  clicking on the location on the map tab,  or geocoding the address either on the map tab or by filling the address fields below.  
* **Coordinate Precision**: Used to specify whether or not a site is marked exactly.  Should be kept as exact for most data,  this is to specify historical data that might not be as accurate as modern data.
* **Elevation**: The elevation of the site,  can be calculated via Google Maps once a location is specified.
* **Address**: The address of the site.
* **Surroundings**: The surroundings of the site.  If **Other** is specified, a text field will appear to clarify.
