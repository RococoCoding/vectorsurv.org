## Geocode
This tool will extract long/lat coordinates from an address typed into the **Location** field or uploaded in a file, which is advantageous for geocoding multiple addresses at once. Note that the geocode file must follow a specific format for the import to be successful, which can be found at the box to the righthand side of the screen.

## Spatial Features
Saved spatial features are useful for filtering within an agency for output/export files. Get started by clicking on "New Feature", then "Add Polygon". Click on the map to add as many vertices as necessary. Name the feature and tick the boxes for the appropriate sharing settings. You can save the feature by clicking on "Save Feature" or "Save Feature As" to use it for data visualization.
